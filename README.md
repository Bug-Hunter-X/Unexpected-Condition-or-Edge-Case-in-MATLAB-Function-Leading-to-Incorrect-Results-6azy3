# MATLAB Function Bug: Unexpected Condition Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in MATLAB functions: the failure to correctly handle unexpected conditions or edge cases.  The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that produces incorrect results under specific inputs due to a flaw in its conditional logic.

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function, addressing the identified issues and enhancing robustness.

## Bug Description
The original `myFunction.m` does not properly handle all possible inputs.  This leads to incorrect outputs when certain conditions are met. The primary problem is an incomplete if-else statement which leads to unintended behavior in certain scenarios.

## Solution
The corrected `bugSolution.m` includes improved input validation and more comprehensive handling of edge cases to avoid unexpected behavior.
